# team-profile-generator

For this project, I created a Team Profile generator using node.js.  To build this generator, I needed to create an index.html document to build the design and add styling, test.js files for the class tests, index.js file to create the user prompts and functions to run the application, and a generateFile.js to dictate what will be sent to the html file.  In order for this program to run as designed, it was necessary to create a package.json and install both "inquirer" and "jest" as a required programs.  

## Using this application
To use this Team Profile Generator, the user will clone this github repository to their device.  Next they will use their terminal to open the folder and will run "node index.js" to execute the generator.  The generator will require the user to answer prompt questions, right in their terminal/command line, then will generate a NewIndex.html, which will display the team roster with the user's entered information.  See the demo video below for an example of usage.
